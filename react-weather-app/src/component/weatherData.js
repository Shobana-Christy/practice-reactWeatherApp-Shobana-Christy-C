    details: `Typical Weather Conditions
Temperature: Expect a significant temperature drop from the beginning to the end of the month. Early November might still have some milder fall days, but by late November, conditions will be much colder, often feeling breezy due to wind.
Precipitation: The month sees a moderate amount of rain (around 3-4 inches), and light rain or drizzles are common. While major snowfall is rare, an early dusting of snow is possible, especially towards the end of November.
Sunshine: There's an average of about 5-6 hours of sunshine per day, with about 10 hours of daylight total. Skies can be partly cloudy.
Humidity/Wind: The air is moderately humid and can feel quite breezy, especially near the water or between tall buildings in Manhattan. 
What to Pack
Dressing in layers is essential to adapt to the fluctuating temperatures between daytime and nighttime, and between indoor and outdoor environments. 
Outerwear: A mid-length or long wool coat is recommended, especially for the evenings. A water-resistant jacket or a trench coat is useful for rainy days.
Clothing: Pack sweaters, long-sleeved shirts, and other layers that can be easily added or removed.
Accessories: A hat, scarf, and gloves are good to have on hand for colder days.
Footwear: Comfortable, waterproof shoes or boots with good soles are ideal for walking on wet sidewalks. Summary of Regional Differences
Midwest and Mountain West (Chicago, Denver): These cities are distinctly colder than NYC in November, typically experiencing significant winter weather, including more frequent snow and freezing temperatures.
Southeast and South (Miami, Atlanta, Dallas): These areas remain much warmer, with temperatures often in the 60s and 70s F, experiencing late autumn or even warm, humid conditions (Miami).
West Coast (LA, SF, Seattle): West Coast cities offer milder temperatures. LA and SF are warmer and much drier, while Seattle has similar temperatures to NYC but receives significantly more rainfall and is less likely to see snow.
Northeast (Boston): Boston has very comparable weather to NYC, perhaps slightly windier and cooler.
In short, NYC in November is a true marker of the transition into winter, offering a mid-range climate when compared to the varying extremes across the US.
In November, New York City's weather is a typical cool, transitional East Coast climate, but it is significantly colder than Southern and West Coast cities and slightly milder than some Midwest cities like Chicago. Here is a comparison of NYC weather in November to other major US cities:
